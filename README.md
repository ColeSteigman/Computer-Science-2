# Computer-Science-2
All of the projects and games that I created in Computer Science 2.



The first project I completed in this class was the Choose Your Own Adventure game. Adam and I each made a different version. This project was assigned so we could learn the basics of coding. We quickly mastered the basics of coding and I finished the game. I then decieded that I wanted to have more than two options for a questions. This proved to be fairly difficult and took me a while to figure out. In the end the game turned out great and just how I wanted it to be. 

The next project I attempted was a pre-coded pong game. Our goal was to change this code to become a simple soccer game. It proved to be too much of a challenge however because we didn't know how to do most of the code, therefore we didn't know what to change. I did learn some from it though. I was able to learn how to change speed of the ball, speed of he paddles, size of the paddles, size of the ball, color, score and I almost got to the point where I could make the paddles move in any direction although not quite. 

Next I created a simple game using a tutorial online. I went to this project next so I could learn more about motion. The tutorial was very helpful and I learned a lot from it. It showed me how to code acceleration of an object. In the game you have an object that if you press a button it accelerates upwards. The object also moves to the right while other obstacles move to the left. It also showed me how to create hit boxes so that I can have a game the stops. 

Currently I am working on another simple game. I am also using a tutorial to help me code it. This has helped me learn how to code objects. Their size, color and position are all codeable. It is also helping me learn how to code movement. Unlike the previous game I coded this object to move left, right, up, down and diagnolly, using the arrow keys instead of a button. It has also showed me how to do hit boxes and end the game with obstacles. A challenging part of this is that I am trying to complete the tutorial with two objects. So far I have gotten them both able to move and they each have hit boxes that can cannect with other objects. Right now I am stuck on trying to code the obstacles to move towards the objects and end the game when they hit. I should soon have it finished and will be able to move on to the next step of tracking the score.
